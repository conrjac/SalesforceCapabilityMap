# Salesforce Capability Map

I've created this as a simple way to present Salesforce Capabilities as a Functional Capability Map. This is a very high level overview and very much is work in progress.

A Functional Capability Map is a strategic tool used in business and technology management to visualise and categorise the capabilities of an organisation or system. It provides a high-level overview of what an organisation can do, focusing on its functions, processes, and resources, rather than how these are implemented.

Key Features of a Functional Capability Map:

1. Hierarchy of Capabilities: It typically displays capabilities in a hierarchical structure, from high-level core capabilities down to more specific sub-capabilities.
2. Business Focus: The map focuses on what the business needs to achieve its goals, making it a powerful tool for aligning business strategy with operational execution.
3. Cross-Functional: A functional capability map spans across different departments or areas within an organisation, identifying capabilities that may exist in different silos but contribute to the same overall function.
4. Abstract Representation: It is abstracted from technology, processes, and organisational structures. The map concentrates on “what” the organisation does rather than “how” it does it.
5. Strategic Planning Tool: It helps in identifying gaps, redundancies, and areas for improvement. It’s often used in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and IT alignment.
6. Roadmap Foundation: It can serve as the foundation for developing roadmaps, prioritising investments, and guiding transformation efforts by aligning them with the organisation’s capabilities.

_Example of Functional Capability Map Components:_

- Core Capabilities: These are the primary functions that drive the business, such as “Product Development,” “Sales and Marketing,” “Customer Service,” etc.
- Supporting Capabilities: These include functions that support the core activities, like “HR Management,” “Finance,” “IT Support,” etc.
- Enabling Capabilities: These might be more specific functions or technologies that enable the primary capabilities, such as “Data Analytics,” “Compliance Management,” or “Supply Chain Optimisation.”
